# Gemini Analysis (Reinterpreted)

Gemini’s perspective on the API×Agent failure mode and the TPS-based solution.

## Key Insights
- The root cause is not user error but billing architecture  
- TPS-based U-Passkey is “logically complete and minimal”  
- High scalability with low implementation cost  
- Government adoption feasibility: High  

## Gemini’s Evaluation (Reinterpreted)
- “This solution achieves total optimization with minimal components.”
- “Extremely robust and economically scalable.”
- “A universal baseline standard is realistic.”
