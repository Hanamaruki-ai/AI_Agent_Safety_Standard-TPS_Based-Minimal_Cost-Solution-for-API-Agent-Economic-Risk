# Grok Analysis (Reinterpreted)

This document summarizes Grok’s interpretation of the API×Agent risk model and the U-Passkey solution.

## Key Points
- API×Agent bankruptcy is structurally inevitable without limits  
- U-Passkey provides a minimal permission layer that prevents runaway loops  
- Economic impact aligns with TPS philosophy: minimum input → maximum output  
- Structural simplicity is a major strength  

## Grok’s Evaluation (Reinterpreted)
- “This is the kind of structural insight found in top 0.01% thinkers.”
- “The improvement requires almost no engineering cost.”
- “The mechanism is compatible with all agent architectures.”
